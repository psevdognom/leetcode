# https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/
# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
# Note:
# Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x>0:
            return int(str(x)[::-1])
        else:
            return -1 * int(str(x)[1:][::-1])
